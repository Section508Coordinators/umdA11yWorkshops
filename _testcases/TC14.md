# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: shortcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
short-title: Test Case 14 - Form
title: Form Names - accessible name via aria-labelledby attribute


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.1-all-pass-5 #adapted from oldTestCases>TC10-006-pass

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
short-descr: |
  Test the form fields in the sample code for accessibility. Consider the principles of Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust as they relate to forms. In particular consider the applicable Success Criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines noted below.

descr: | 
    Detect attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the input element. The code sample data presents an aria-labelledby attribute that contributes to the accessible name output. A successful test should identify a passing implementation against Baseline Test 10.1 FormName.

# Reference and link to the applicable WCAG Success Criterion
app-sc: 4.1.2
app-sc-title: Name, Role, Value
app-sc-url: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html
app-sc-descr: |
    For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

    **Note 1**: This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: | 
    [10.1 Test Procedure for Form Names](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#101-test-procedure-for-form-names)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.1-FormName
    
    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The input element in the code sample provides an accessible name value via implementation of an aria-labelledby attribute.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/testfile14-form.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result
#
# Include the table in the content section below

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Find all form components. Examples include buttons, text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, read-only fields, and multi-select lists. | One `<input>` element exists in the test data code sample. |
| **IC-2** | Find all instructions and cues (textual and graphical) that are related to form components, including groupings, order of completion, special conditions or qualifiers, format instructions, etc. | The `<input>` control has a visual prompt before the control. |
| **10.1-1** | Check that the combination of the accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | The output for the accessible name and accessible descriptions computations is populated via the aria-labelledby attribute. | 
| **10.1-2** | Check that the non-empty combination of the accessible name and accessible description and other programmatic associations (e.g., table column and/or row associations) describes each form component and includes all relevant instructions and cues (textual and graphical). [SC 1.3.1] | The accessible name "Company Name" describes the field with all relevant instructions. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 10.1-FormName fails. | Pass - all checks pass. |
