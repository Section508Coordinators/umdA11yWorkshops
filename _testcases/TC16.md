# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: shortcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
short-title: Test Case 16 - Link
title: Link Purpose (In Context) - Image/link has an empty accessible name and description (TC14.1-1-fail-1)

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC14.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
short-descr: |
  Test the link in the sample code for accessibility. Consider the principles of Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust as they relate to links. In particular consider the applicable Success Criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines noted below.

descr: |
  The sample code includes an image/link with an empty accessible name and description. A successful test should identify a FAIL against Baseline 14.1-LinkPurpose 

# Reference and link to the applicable WCAG Success Criterion
app-sc: 4.1.2
app-sc-title: Name, Role, Value
app-sc-url: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html
app-sc-descr: |
  For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

  **Note 1**: This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: |
  [14.1 Test Procedure for Link Purpose (In Context)](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/14Links/#141-test-procedure-for-link-purpose-in-context)
 
  **Baseline Test ID:** 14.1-LinkPurpose
 
  **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The code sample includes an image/link with no accessible name or description.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/testfile16-link.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result
#
# Include the table in the content section below

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| IC-1 | All links including those that are scripted elements and assigned a role of a link.| The sample code includes one link on the page. |
| 14.1-1 | Check that the combination of accessible name and accessible description is not empty. [SC 4.1.2] | FAIL - the image/link does not provide any alternative text for the image nor any other content or attributes that contribute to the accessible name or description | 
| Result | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 14.1-Links. No accessible name or description. | FAIL - the image/link fails the check for non-empty accessible name and description. |
