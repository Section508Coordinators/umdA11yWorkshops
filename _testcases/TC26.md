# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: shortcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
short-title: Test Case 26 - Language
title: Language of Parts - Invalid language subtag


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC15.2-3-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
short-descr: |
  Test the text in the sample code for accessibility. Consider the principles of Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust as they relate to the language of the content. In particular consider the applicable Success Criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines noted below.

descr: | 
    Detect the existence of <code>lang</code> attribute for text (part) that differs from the default human language of the page. Determine if the value of the <code>lang</code> attribute is correct for the language of the part. The value must also be identified in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority's IANA Language subtag registry.

    The code sample provides a page in English with a part in French, with the language of the French part identified with invalid language subtag of "fre" . A successful test should identify a FAIL for Baseline 15.2-LanguagePart.

app-sc: |
    [Success Criterion 3.1.2: Language of Parts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-parts.html) - The human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text.

    [15.2 Test Procedure for Language of Parts](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/15Language.html#152-test-procedure-for-language-of-parts)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 15.2-LanguagePart
    
    **Test Instruction:** 3

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The French part has <code>lang="fre"</code>, which is not a valid language subtag. The correct language subtag for French is "fr".

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Text content that differs from the default human language of the page including alternative text for non-text content.| Applicable: the English page has a part in French |
| **15.2-1** | Identify the human language of the text content that differs from the default human language of the page. | French | 
| **15.1-2** | Check that the `lang` attribute is specified for any HTML element that contains a content segment that differs from the default human language of the page. [SC 3.1.2] | Pass: `<blockquote lang="fre">` |
| **15.1-3** | Check that the value of the `lang` attribute is correctly defined for the content segment. [SC 3.1.2] | Fail: "fr" is the correct language subtag for French, not "fre". |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 15.1-LanguagePage fails. | Fail: 15.1-3 fails. |
