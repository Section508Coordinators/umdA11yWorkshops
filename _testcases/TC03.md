# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: shortcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
short-title: Test Case 3 - Image
title: Meaningful Image - text equivalent in aria-label attribute


# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC06.1-all-pass-3

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
short-descr: |
    Test the image in the sample code for accessibility. Consider the principles of Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust as they relate to images. In particular consider the applicable Success Criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines noted below.

descr: | 
    Detect existence of attributes that would contribute to the accessible name and accessible description computation and calculate the text alternative for the image. Then determine whether the text alternative output for the image provides an equivalent description of the image.

    The code sample provides an equivalent description of the image in an <code>aria-label</code> attribute. A successful test should identify a PASS against Baseline 6.1 Meaningful Images.

# Reference and link to the applicable WCAG Success Criterion
app-sc: 1.1.1
app-sc-title: Non-text Content
app-sc-url: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html
app-sc-descr: |
    All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

    **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)

    **Time-Based Media**: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)

    **Test**: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

    **Sensory**: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.

    **CAPTCHA**: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.

    **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.

app-baseline: | 
    [6.1 Test Procedure for Meaningful Images](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/06Images.html#61-test-procedure-for-meaningful-images)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 6.1-MeaningfulImage
    
    **Test Instruction:** All

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: PASS

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: The image in the code sample has a descriptive accessible name from its <code>aria-label</code> attribute.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/testfile3-image.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result

| Test Instruction | Instruction Detail | Expected Test Case Result |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | Identify any image that conveys information (include images of text; functional images used to initiate action, convey meaning, or prompting a response; image maps, etc.) | One `<img>` exists in the test data code sample. The image is meaningful and conveys information, based on the text directly below the image. |
| **6.1-1** | Check that the text alternative (combination of the accessible name and accessible description) is not empty. [SC 1.1.1] | Pass: The image's non-empty accessible name from `aria-label` is "Bland Corp. logo". | 
| **6.1-2** | Check that the non-empty text alternative (combination of accessible name and accessible description) provides an equivalent description. Numerous attributes contribute to the computation of the accessible name and accessible description. Refer to HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 for img. [SC 1.1.1] | Pass: The image's accessible name "Bland Corp. logo" is an equivalent description. |
| **6.1-2a** | Descriptions of the image that are provided by page content must be programmatically associated. | Not applicable |
| **6.1-2b** | When an image is updated to convey a new meaning, check that its text alternative is updated at the same time. [SCs 1.1.1 and 4.1.2] | Not applicable  |
| **6.1-3** | Check that the ARIA role is NOT "presentation".| Pass |
| **6.1-4** | Check that the ARIA role is NOT "none". | Pass |
| **6.1-5** | Check that aria-hidden is NOT set to "true". | Pass |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 6.1-MeaningfulImage fails. | All checks PASS (or do not apply). |
