# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: shortcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
short-title: Test Case 12 - Keyboard
title: Keyboard Access - functionality not keyboard accessible

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC[Baseline Test Procedure #]-[Test Instruction #]-
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC01.1-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
short-descr: |
  Test the interactive content in the sample code for keyboard accessibility. Consider the principles of Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust as they relate to keyboard access. In particular consider the applicable Success Criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines noted below.

descr: |
  Determine the functionality of visible and hidden interactive interface components (links, form fields, drop down menus, show/hide content, tree views, pop ups/light boxes, iframes, etc.) available using a mouse (hover and/or click). Can they also be accessed and executed using only a keyboard?

  The code sample includes elements that aren't accessible via keyboard and have no alternative on the page that is keyboard accessible. A successful test should identify a failure against Baseline 1. Keyboard Accessible.

# Reference and link to the applicable WCAG Success Criterion
app-sc: |
  [Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html) - 
  All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

  **Note 1**: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.

  **Note 2**: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

# Reference and link to the applicable ICT Baseline test
app-baseline: |
  [1.1 Test Procedure for Keyboard Access](https://section508coordinators.github.io/ICTTestingBaseline/01Keyboard.html#11-test-procedure-for-keyboard-access)
  
    **Baseline Test ID:** 1.1-KeyboardAccess
    
    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: Fail

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: Not all interactive interface components can be accessed by keyboard or have an alternative control on the page with the same funtionality that is available by keyboard. Specifically, the city and area code form fields have a tabindex of -1 and their functionality is not available elsewhere on the page.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.
sample: /testfiles/testfile12-keyboard.html

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result

|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **IC-1** | All functionality of the content that is available by mouse control must be keyboard accessible. Determine the functionality of visible and hidden interactive interface components (links, form fields, drop down menus, show/hide content, tree views, pop ups/light boxes, iframes, etc.) available using a mouse (hover and/or click). | Seven form fields are accessible via mouse. Two are not available via keyboard and have no alternative control. | 
| **1.1-1** | Check that all functionality that is available via mouse can also be accessed via keyboard alone. | Fail: the city and area code form fields cannot be accessed via keyboard alone. |
| **1.1-1a** | If 1.1-1a fails, check whether the failed functionality is available via keyboard alone through another control on the page with the same functionality | Fail: there is no keyboard-accessible means for entering the information requested in the city and area code form fields. |
| **Result** | If any of the above checks fail, then Baseline Test 1.1-KeyboardAccess fails. | Fail - 1.1-1 check fails. |
