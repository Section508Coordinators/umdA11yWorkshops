# The layout must be 'testcase'; DO NOT Change
layout: shortcase

# Brief, descriptive title for the test case
short-title: Test Case 15 - Form
title: Form component with no label nor instructions

# The Test Case ID should follow the pattern: 
# TC10.5-1-fail-1
# [Expected Result (pass/fail/dna)]-[example #], e.g., TC05.1-1-fail-1
tcid: TC10.5-1-fail-1

# Description of the Test Case, the included code sample, test considerations,
# and rationale for the expected result according to the applicable ICT
# Baseline test
short-descr: |
  Test the content in the sample code for accessibility. Consider the principles of Perceiveable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust as they relate to forms. In particular consider the applicable Success Criterion from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines noted below.

descr: | 
    Detect an identifiable label or prompt for the input element. The code sample presents a form input field that lacks any labeling element or textual instruction. A successful test should identify that the form control does not have a label, resulting in a failed test against Baseline Test 10.5 FormHasLabel.

    [10.5 Test Procedure for Form has a Label](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/10Forms/#105-test-procedure-for-form-has-a-label)

    **Baseline Test ID:** 10.5-FormHasLabel

    **Test Instruction:** 1

# Expected result that the ICT Baseline would predict
# [Pass | Fail | DNA]
result: FAIL

# Brief description of the rationale for the expected result
result-descr: |
    The form component is unlabeled.

# URL for the code sample
# In the sample code file, add id="tc_code" to the 
# element that contains the relevant code snippet.
#
# Then upload the code sample to the 'testfiles' folder 
# and provide the link (and only the url) below.

# Table of test instructions, including the following table headers: 
# Test Instruction #; Instruction Detail; Expected Test Case Result

| IC-1| Find all form components. Examples include buttons, text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, multi-select lists.| Input field found. |
| IC-2| Find all instructions and cues (textual and graphical) that are related to form components, including groupings, order of completion, special conditions or qualifiers, format instructions, etc.| |
| 10.5-1 | Check that each form component has label(s) or instructions. [SC 3.3.2]  | Fail. There is no visible label or prompt. |
